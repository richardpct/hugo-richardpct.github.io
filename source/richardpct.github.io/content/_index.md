### My personal blog

Hello world !

My name is Richard and I live in Paris. I am a DevOps/SRE engineer and I have
worked in many lines of business for some large French companies such as
telecom, rail transport, banking, and so on.<br/>
I have decided to create this website to share with you my experience with
automation and infrastructure like code, containers, cloud computing,
programming and much more.

The purpose of this blog is to keep track of what I have accomplished so far
and to push myself to learn more. This blog provides mainly technical contents.
<br/>
I hope you enjoy my personal website !
