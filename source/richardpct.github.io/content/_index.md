### My personal blog

Hello world !

My name is Richard and I live in Paris, I am DevOps/SRE Engineer and I have
worked in many lines of business for some large French companies such as
telecom, rail transport, banking...

I have decided to create this website to share with you my experience about
`automation`, `infrastructure as code`, `containers`, `cloud computing`,
`programming` and much more.<br />
The purpose of writing this blog is because I need to remember what I have
done, there are so much knowledge to learn when you work as a DevOps/SRE
Engineer. This blog is mainly about technical contents.

I hope you enjoy my personnal website !
